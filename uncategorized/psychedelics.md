- What is the relation between psychedelics and myths? [Some thoughts from Sam Wolfe](https://www.samwoolfe.com/2013/09/ancient-motifs-in-psychedelic.html)

This is a rabbit hole, I could spend a lot of time thinking about:

[[psychedelic-cryptography]]
[[cognition-and-myths]] I wonder if AI cognitive systems could have their own myth. How does Joseph Campbell's monomyth relate to AI?
[[ai-and-myths]]
[[psychedelics-and-criticality]]
