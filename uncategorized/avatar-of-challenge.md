title: Avatar of Challenge

Usually, in my darkest hours I will think of the challenge I'm dealing with as its own agent. Something that is challenging me to overcome it.

It will have a personification, or rather an avatar, animorph, etc... For me, it is a wolf, or canine-like creature. I'm not sure if it is the same as the [[wolf-of-reality]], thought I think it is, only with a less menacing aura/appearance.

This avatar will usually have eyes (which remind me of the [[eyes-i-see-at-close-eyes]] I sometimes see). I relate this to [[abyss-gaze]].

For me, it is similar to the Big Bad Wolf character in Puss in Boots 2, when you are down, he tells you to "pick it up" (your weapon) and keep fighting.
