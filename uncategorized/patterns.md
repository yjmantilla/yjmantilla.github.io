See the work of Christopher Alexander.

Copilot comment:

>He is the father of the concept of patterns. He is an architect, but his work is very relevant to AI. He has a book called "The Nature of Order" which is a 4 volume book. I have only read the first volume, but it is very interesting. I think it is very relevant to AI. I think it is very relevant to LLMs. I think it is very relevant to my PhD. I think it is very relevant to my life. I think it is very relevant to the universe. I think it is very relevant to everything.

Reminds me a bit of [farnam street](https://fs.blog/blog/) blog, which is also about patterns in mental models, decision making, etc.

Also some work of [John Clarke](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Thinking-Integrating-Learning-Teaching/dp/0205123619).

I suppose these business of cards to address problems between people is basically finding this patterns and deploying them on sight to make it easier for people to recognize them (rather than trying to find them on their own). Kind of related to the [[recognition-vs-recall thing]]. There are many around the world I believe:

- Colombia: [opencards](https://opencards.co/Kits)
