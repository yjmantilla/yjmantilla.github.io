[[representation]]

A lot of the discussion about abstract representations seem to arise from the linguistic and cognitive fields (also psycholinguistics). Moreover, one may ask, abstract in opposition to what. Ive found that it is usually in opposition to concrete representations. But also about embodied representations. I have also found that there is some relation to the concept of [[semantics]]. In example, concrete and abstract semantics.

Asking ChatGPT-4 about this he does the distinction:

>Semantics and Representations: Semantics generally refers to the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences in language. In cognitive science, this involves understanding how the brain encodes, processes, and retrieves the meaning of linguistic items. Mental representations are the internal, mental constructs that the brain uses to handle this semantic information. They can be about concrete objects (like a chair) or abstract concepts (like justice).

I do wish I had better sources of this fundamental definitions. Though, it is almost self-explanatory why would this be the case. Like common knowledge. I should find better sources.
