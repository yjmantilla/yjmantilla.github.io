From a conversation with a friend

>In any case, the point of all of this rambling is that spiritually, im scared of the immaterial and my spirituality as in -my sense of transcendence- consist on my view of admiring reality with all of its complexity and simplicity, with all i can understand and I cannot. And through communication with others, human and non-human, living and non-living Im part of a mysterious network that is made by us all.  For me, the ultimate graph that describes all of the relations between all of which have existed and have not existed is infinitely beautiful and unimaginable, is beyond comprehension and of size unmatched.  Truly I think not even gods can grasp it, because they would be only a part of it. To me, this graph connects me and you and all of the atoms between us. It connects beings emotionally, physically and spiritually. It is the realms of realms, the connection of connections, the world of worlds, and the law of laws. It contains every step made by me and every ant and every cell. Within it, is all history in all senses, future and past. It is "beyond".
