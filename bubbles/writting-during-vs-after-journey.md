title: Writing During vs After Journey
---

RMB had some comments and books about this...

Bol√≠var wrote during... Something like that.

Writings after the fact are devoid of the tension maybe... As it is resolved by the time you finally sit down to write.

If you write during, you can really see the struggles on the spot, infraganti. The quality of the narration will be purer.

Otherwise, some of the emotion is lost by the resolution of the situation through the natural passage of time.
