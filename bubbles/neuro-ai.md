# Neuro-AI

I was always looking for this concept by myself but lately it seems it has gained some momentum to become an area by itself. Check the MAIN 2021 conference:

- Student Panel discussion: Career paths in Neuro-AI /  Raymond Chua (McGill University), Jean-Baptiste Poline (McGill University), Irina Rish (Université de Montréal & Mila), Hao Ting Wang (Université de Montréal) [Moderator: Charlotte Maschke (McGill University)]

- Panel discussion: Inspiring the future : Activism and Advocacy in Neuro-AI  / Ahmed El Hady (University of Konstanz / Princeton University), Jordan Harrod (Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, MA, USA), LLana James (AI, Medicine and Data Justice Post-Doctoral Fellow - Queen's University), Jason E. Lewis (Concordia University) - [Co-moderators: Danielle Nadin (Black In Neuro) & Karim Jerbi (Université de Montréal & Mila)]


## Some discussion on reddit and other places:

I have also found people discussing the concept indirectly:
