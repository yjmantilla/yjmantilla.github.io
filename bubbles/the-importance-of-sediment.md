# The importance of sediment

When I did my first trip to Canada and met with my old school friend J, he told he didnt like to binge watch shows. I dont recall his exacts words but nowadays I conceptualize it as follows:

We need time to digest experiences and things. If we cram it, reflection is lost, deepness is lost. You need time to assimilate. The flavor of what you got from it will be different.

In a way is like the subconscious goes through the thing it self through time, it needs to sediment for each to reach a significant meaning (redundant?)...
