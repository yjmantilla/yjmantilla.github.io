# Scientific Writing with Karen L. McKee

Just found this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDEeAVnl0p1Wj5ngF8JlMA). I should probably summarize some of her awesome videos.

Some videos that caught my eye:

- How to Read a Scientific Paper Efficiently and Critically: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXJeU2dzzWo
- Writing is Thinking: https://youtu.be/tX9asHdFSv4 --> I think this also applies to code. Code forces you to get rid of ambiguity, which forces us to understand.
- How to Use Narrative Structure in a Scientific Paper: https://youtu.be/XW77hpjNTvY 
- How to Write Clearly: Cohesion and Coherence: https://youtu.be/FpOPA3GFeJg
