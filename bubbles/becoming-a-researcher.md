title: "Becoming a Researcher"
---

How does one become a researcher? I think this is one of the main topics that RMB is interested in.

Anyhow, I found this project called [Growing Up in Science](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/) which is a collection of interviews with researchers. I think it is a good resource to get a sense of what it is like to be a researcher. I should probably share this with RMB.

Reading about it, it does remind me a lot about a discussion and comments I had when my older sister defended her undegrad thesis. Basically about the importance of journaling because without it, you forget a lot of the process of doing research, which is in itself relevant to others who are doing research.

A friend of here argued that science is objective as the only thing that should be published is that part, or something like that. To me, with this focus it felt like important stuff was lost.

Ramon y Cajal has a book called ["Advice for a Young Investigator"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262681506/advice-for-a-young-investigator/) -[summary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5198756/)- which I think is a good resource for this topic.
