## Encanto

Im not fully colombian (Im a venezuelan-colombian mix) , but in any case I was really happy with the representation and the movie struck many chords within myself, particularly being a migrant. I have seen some Colombian people that didnt like it but overall I think most colombians loved it. The movie can only show so much of Colombia when it is only just below two hours of screening. In my opinion, with the little time they had; I think they did a lot. 

Regarding magical realism, Im not knowledgeable of the genre besides having read "One Hundred Years of Solitude" in high school (i really liked it), along with some short latinoamerican novels; so in that sense I cannot really analyze the movie from that pov apart from the obvious idea of magic being embedded in the mundane, as a normal part of reality. 

I think Encanto will age quite well precisely because the themes it touches and its good execution of them. I have seen people relating to it even if they dont have latinoamerican roots.  I have lost some good hours seeing the reactions from people of other parts of the world here in youtube... The only problem I noticed was of pacing (the end feels rushed, if only we could stay more time in that universe); but in my opinion the strengths of the movie supersedes that problem. Some people think that Mirabel being heroic by just being more empathetic with his sister is underwhelming, and to be honest I felt like that too for a bit; but in retrospective I think thats one of the strengths, it is not a colossal adventure, but a mundane one embedded in magic. Is magical realism...

## Movies I wouldnt watch again, for good reasons
