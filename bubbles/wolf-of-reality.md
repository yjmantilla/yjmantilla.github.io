title: Wolf of Reality
---

Just a wolf (usually female, "la realidad"), that I imagine when I'm feeling bad because of the current state of my [[perspective-reality]]. I will imagine that this wolf -although challenging me as reality-, does not mean harm to me; and even more so, tries to soothe me.
