# will-of-places

I feel like places kind of have a will. Some places actively root for you, for example, universities. I feel them like that.

When I'm about to leave a country, I'm usually more mindful of this. Probably because of the surreal sensation, and the hyperfocus of noticing little details, how people are, how the environment is, when you get nostalgic as you leave.

In a sense, you can find companionship in landmarks, and places, environments and so on...

Similar ideas can be found in Clannad,1st season and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chilli Peppers.

>Nagisa:"If perhaps this town has the same will as that of the people's hearts, and if we should bring happiness to those who live in this town, if such feelings should exist, then perhaps the town brought about this miracle. But that wouldn't be a miracle, would it? The people who love this town live here, and the town that loves them will love them. That should be the case, no matter where it may be. We love the town, bringing it up."
Tomoya: "So the town is a big family?"
Nagisa: "Yes, the Dango Daikazoku."
