> you are more likely to stick to a task long term if you are leaving it when you are not finding it interesting.

> When I am stuck for one moment I leave it and do something else. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.

Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987

This is also productive, leave that piece of work you are feeling stuck with and do something else. When you come back later you may crack it. [[focused-and-diffused]] This productivity idea was also mentioned by David Altuve (USB).

There is a sort of belief that whatever bored you will attract you when it becomes relevant to your curiosity journey, as Elizabeth puts it:

> i think you need to have a strong curiosity about the topic as a whole and then kind of flick from one thing that you find interesting to the next thing to the next thing to the next thing you will come back to the thing that you suddenly left when it becomes relevant in another point so rather than forcing yourself to just take in all this information without it sticking anywhere you can go to it as and when it becomes relevant and interesting

In a way, this is exactly what I'm doing with my wayward project [[wayward]]

I would argue, curiosity jumping is also motivated by "[[for-the-sake-of-play]]"
