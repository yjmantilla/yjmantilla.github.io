title: "Becoming a Professor"
---

RMB told be about this book: [What the Best College Teachers Do by Ken Bain](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674013255).

She has also many good insights on how to become a professor. I dont have their summary though.

But I remember something about it identifying the set of experiences you need to expose the student develop, which is a highly personal thing. Its centered in an individualized approach to teaching.
