title: Literature Matrix

I first encountered this concept on the course "Vigilancia Tecnologica" of the UdeA, although they didnt give it an explicit name. My professor of Fundamentos de Inteligencia Computacional (Claudia Isaza), also show it and made us make one without giving it a name.  Nevertheless the concept itself does exist.
