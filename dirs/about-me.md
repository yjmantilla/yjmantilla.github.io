## Yorguin José Mantilla Ramos

- Electronics Engineer.
- Passionate about understanding natural and artificial intelligence.
- I like to think critically:
  - about models, their interpretability and explainability;
  - about data and knowledge, their representation and visceralization;
  - how and why cognition arises, works and came to be;
  - the relation between form and function;
  - and in general, the models, algorithms, methods and perspectives we use to understand, reverse engineer and think about entities and processes.
- I’m captivated by systems, complexity, curious dynamics, life-like behavior and emergence.
- Amateur musician, occasional poet, chaotic dancer, math aficionado, epistemology and philosophy-of-science enthusiast.
- My work is built upon the values of responsibility, commitment, honesty, attention to detail, problem solving and critical thinking.
