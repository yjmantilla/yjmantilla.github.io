# week-10--august-9--to--august-15

## 1 What have you been doing this week?

- [x] Got a fully working preliminary version of the front-end
- [x] Document the WEB RPC API better
- [x] Analyzed the results of the poll done on w8 and presented them to the mentors
- [x] Discussed with the mentors the final targets for the GSoC
- [ ] Make API example doc --> To be done on the weekend
- [x] finished info level logging functionality for main functions (apply_rules and convert_them)

## 2 What are you planning to do next week?

The final targets discussed with the mentors:

- Documenting a example of the GUI usage, so that the mentors can test it on various datasets
- Implement the heuristic for inferring the path pattern from an example in the rules file
- Make test and documentation for the incremental conversion use-case (the poll determined that to be a really important issue)

## 3 Is anything blocking your progress?

This week, nope hehe. Just a lot of work from school which restarted a couple of weeks ago.
