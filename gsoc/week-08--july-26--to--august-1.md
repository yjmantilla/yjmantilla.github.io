## 3 Is anything blocking your progress?

Well, my university started classes already, so now is going to be hard to maintain the same rhythm of development I did previously. Rather than doing 4 hours a day from monday to friday. I will have to do 2 and a half hours a day from monday to friday and do de 6 hours left on the weekend.
