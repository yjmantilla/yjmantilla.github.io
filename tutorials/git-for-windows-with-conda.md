How to use a bash style terminal in windows with conda commands activated.

## Download and install git for windows

[install this](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## Search for your .bash_profile file in your user folder

In my case is here ```C:\Users\user```

## Edit it and add

```. "C:\software\anaconda3\etc\profile.d\conda.sh"```

You should edit this path accordingly. Find your ```conda.sh``` file.
