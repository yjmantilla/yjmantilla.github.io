title: Tags in filenames
---

This idea comes from tagspaces software (but without the software).

Other idea: put tags with weird characters as prefix and/or suffix [source](https://productivityist.com/merlin-x-factor-evernote/)

And this would be specially nice for creating dynamic playlist based on tags customized by the user, and cross-platform.

It seems that this dream would be finally be feasible by a combination of onedrive, foobar in android (to play files) and Rs File Manager in Android (access onedrive, is able to rename on the fly and calls foobar).

I need to do a python script to manage the tag ontology. From a text (the full filenames list) get the unique used tags set.
