Chronolink: [[2023-12-20]]

I talked to Venkatesh today, mostly about PhD application stuff... But we diverted towards AI memes. It made me think about the curious  phenomena that arise from LLMs.

GPT suggest writing about "the curious phenomena that arise from LLMs"...

Anyway this is my zoo of curious phenomena that arise from LLMs: [[the-curious-phenomena-that-arise-from-LLMs]]

During writing of that post I read about [[ChainForge]] [ChainForge](https://chainforge.ai/docs/) which may be useful for LLM experimentation.

I found out that if you look for ["representational similarity analysis llm" in google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=0&q=representational+similarity+analysis+llm&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5), you do get some stuff that is relevant to LLMs. I think I will try to read some of these papers. Probably this would be similar to at least some of the stuff that I would be doing in my PhD.

Moreover, I talked with Massimo about the work of Christopher Alexander regarding [[patterns]].

This whole literature review thing has encouraged me to do a list of [[interesting-research-entities]] to follow up on.

Also, what would be [[my-research-programme]]?

Thought a bit on the [[vasopressin-bonding-effect]].

and [[becoming-a-researcher]], [[becoming-a-professor]].

Also briefly stumbled upon a blog about [[psychedelics]]
