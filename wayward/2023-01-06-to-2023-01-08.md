Chronolink: [[2023-01-05]]

These days I haven't been able to concentrate much. My mental state ain't the best and there were some family-related important stuff I had to do (my aunt and backup of family photos).

I did read here and there about some stuff and relevant concepts crossed my mind:

- The [[avatar-of-challenge]], which is something I have been thinking for a while as a result of my emotional struggles. I was reminded of it also by the character of the Big Bad Wolf from Puss in boots 2.
- The [[will-of-places]] which is a concept I have thought about whenever Im about to move from a place.
- This idea of a study of thought [[representation]]s, or information representations in general. How we think and how machines think.
- This idea of [[algorithms-as-abstract-representations]]
- About [[the-can-that-moves]] (Massimo's game).
- Some books: [[text-horizonte-de-sucesos]],[[text-libro-de-animales]]
- Relato [[text-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream]]
- The [[squire-attire]]
- [[video-the-paradox-of-rules-in-games-and-life]]
