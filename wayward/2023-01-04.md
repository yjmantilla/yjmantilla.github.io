# 2023-01-04 I'm finally starting

Chronolink: [[2023-01-03]]

After a family visit, my plan is to digest two videos at least:

- [Youâ€™re Not Stupid: How to Easily Learn Difficult Things - 
Elizabeth Filips](https://youtu.be/Kz_brQBl8xk)
- [Focusing Your Unconscious Mind: Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever) - Colin Galen](https://youtu.be/Dm68uFy6gus)

Before even starting I'm encountering a lot of blockage, sort of like unconciously sabotaging myself not to do it... procrastination??. I also have a mild headache. Anyway, I just gotta do it...

I'm going to test linking to a specific section of a document too. That would be useful for subchunking.

Before starting though, I had [[overheating]] problems on my laptop, which I hope I solved them with temperature throttling.

It just ocurred to me that if I want to spend my life talking about ideas, then I need to have a [[bestiary]], inventory... and so on of ideas. [[archeology-of-knowledge]]

In anycase, during the process of assimilating just the first video (Elizabeth's) I got infinitely lost in the way [[curiosity-jumping]]. This makes me think that I should probably have balance between this wayward project and other intellectual duties (such as paper writing).

Conclusion--> At least I did the first video.
