Chronolink: [[2023-01-04]]

Didnt do anything besides researching stuff related to [[novelty-search]], inspired by some facebook debate on AI art. I trying to remember an article I read on the importance of the AI to explore freely rather than only go for the immediate reward. The article consisted of like an image generation AI that would be fedback with user input. And that by ignoring most interesting images at first, you could arrive at better solutions later. I cant find the article though. I think one of the examples was trying to generate an image similar to an animal. The article had a dark background (it was on the internet, not a pdf).

I also saw a post on facebook that directed me towards [[are_yes_or_no_questions_science]]
