Im going my own way regarding how to build the literature review. Usually people do a literature matrix, but I went towards a literature network. Playing with Chat GPT I was able to implement a dat.gui filter for the literature network. The network is built using force graph js. I also added a search bar to the network, so you can search for a specific paper. Hopefully this will be useful for my whole PhD journey. I also think it is more fun to explore the literature this way. I built it in integration with this wiki, so I can add papers to the network by adding a link to the paper in the wiki. In a way, it contributes to the knowledge graph of the wiki. Its all one and the same.
