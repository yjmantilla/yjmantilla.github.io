Chronolink: [[2023-12-19]]

I have a bit of anxiety on how to start writing the project proposal, adding to the whole PhD application itself. Timing does not seem to be on my side.

In any case, lets start from the beginning. The project overall theme is "Abstract Representations in Brains and Machines". Its quite a thought provoking theme, and I am not sure how to approach it. I have a few ideas.

What are [[abstract-representations]] anyway? Im gonna see what I can find in the net about it. And write it in that bubble.
