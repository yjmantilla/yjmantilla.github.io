Sadly, I didnt do much today. Had a discussion with my aunt (monjita) about formative research.

Apart from that I just fixed the Link Reference Definition Autogenerator (see [[foam]])

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[foam]: .././tutorials/foam "foam"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
