# It's different in the rain though

She said:
                It's different in the rain though.
                It's freeing.
                Like the rain washed away all your troubles with each step.

With each droplet, it washed your sorrows away.
I don't know if you danced to the sound of the rain,
or if that rain fell down to the sound of your steps.


                I believe we danced in a rhythm of our own,.
                Unheard by those who have never truly experienced that sort of freedom.


Was it magic that fell with the rain?
Or was it your soul going up to sky?
Climbing along the droplets that fell.
Climbing to the clouds that cried.

And they told you:
"Are you pursuing the freedom of the air?"
"Did you dance all the way up here to learn the secrets of the sky?"
"Did you want to fly and dance like a bird?"
"Are you pursuing the dance-full life?"
