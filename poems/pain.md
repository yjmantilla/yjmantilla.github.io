# Pain

Maybe for example<br/>
one should decompose<br/>
pain into pieces<br/>
eat it 3 times a day and no more,
except...<br/> 
that you find yourself eating snacks of it<br/>
everytime you are not distracted<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably you would find your pain<br/>
becoming friends with your pulse<br/>
