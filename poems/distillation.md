# Distillation

So it has been a really really bumpy road,<br/>
that of distilling my feelings.<br/>
I tried to dissect my emotional being,<br/>
little by little,<br/>
feeling by feeling,<br/>
to unmask those who are fake<br/>
and those who are not mutual,<br/>
those who are selfish,<br/>
and those who are purely<br/>
my gift to you.<br/>
