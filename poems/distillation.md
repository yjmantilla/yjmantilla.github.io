# Distillation

```markdown
So it has been a really really bumpy road,
that of distilling my feelings.
I tried to dissect my emotional being,
little by little,
feeling by feeling,
to unmask those who are fake
and those who are not mutual,
those who are selfish,
and those who are purely

my gift to you.
