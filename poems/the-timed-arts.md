# The timed arts

```markdown
Poetry like music...
        needs cadence.
At least metered poetry,
so verses must feel like a melody,
and verse after verse they resemble each other.

You won't even know the same melody reached your ears,
they were after all different words.

Poetry, music, and dancing;
the beautiful triad of the timed arts.
It is time that flows through
your body, your eyes, your ears, and your heart.

If you wanted, 
        you could dance to spoken poetry.
If you wanted,
        you could make poetry out of dance.
If I could,
    I would make you dance forever
    to the verses that flow out of my hand.
