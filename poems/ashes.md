# Delusional Ashes

Let's say then, that between you and me<br/>
there is no difference,<br/>
that we are both children of the same universe,<br/>
and that the wind caressing your face<br/>
was the same wind that took away my sighs;<br/>
and hopefully these verses...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what gives...<br/>
What do I really know of air?<br/>
What do I really know of oxygen?<br/>
of carbon dioxide...<br/>
and of the myelin surrounding your nerves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can only suppose they exist;<br/>
but I cannot prove it<br/>
if I dont get outside of my own self.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and then you come,<br/>
and startle me with a kiss,<br/>
and I get out of myself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I leap into you<br/>
and I venture into your mouth.<br/>
I build the bridge at the same time that I cross it.<br/>
I know now that you exist,<br/>
not because of your lips,<br/>
not because of your eyes,<br/>
but because I leapt into you<br/>
... and I found myself<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We could then<br/>
stand side by side<br/>
in front of a mirror,<br/>
suddenly smile;<br/>
and in the reflection<br/>
we wont know<br/>
who is who.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I go by<br/>
creating writings<br/>
-before they were for someone, now they are for a ghost-.<br/>
Null purpose.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I write because I'm text myself.<br/>
I am a book<br/>
which is written and read by itself.<br/>
I am a paradox divided by 0 without knowing the existence of limits.<br/>
I go and make logical mistakes,<br/>
and the ashes of that becomes music<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ashes,
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The ashes,
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Only the ashes
