## What is Soft Computing ? (adapted from L.A. Zadeh)

Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind. 

## What is Hard Computing?

- Hard computing, i.e., conventional computing, requires a precisely stated analytical model and often a lot of computation time.
- Many analytical models are valid for ideal cases.
- Real world problems exist in a non-ideal environment.
